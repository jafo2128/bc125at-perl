-------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Perl-based utility for configuring/programming the Uniden BC125AT on Linux

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Getting started:

  1. perl Makefile.PL
  2. make
  3. make install
  4. perldoc bc125at-perl

If you want driver reloading to be achievable from the GUI (a fairly useful
thing to be able to do) without having to run the entire thing as root,
please follow these additional steps during the initial install, which will
install a setuid helper program (you, the user, are responsible for deciding
whether this setuid program meets your security requirements):

  1. cd driver-helper
  2. make
  3. sudo make install
    -or-
  3. su root -c "cd $(pwd) && make install"
